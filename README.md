# DecafMUD for the Discworld

> The Web-based MUD Client for the [Discworld MUD](http://discworld.atuin.net/lpc/)

This MUD client started life as [version 0.9.0](https://github.com/stendec/DecafMUD) of Stendec's wonderful [DecafMUD](http://decafmud.stendec.me/. Much credit and thanks go to Stendec for the client.

Going forward, this particular client will be entirely devoted to the Discworld MUD. There will be no attempt at general support for all MUDs. The goal here is to provide the best possible client for the Disc, and that's all.
