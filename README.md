# DecafMUD

Web-based MUD Client for the [Discworld MUD](http://discworld.atuin.net/lpc/)

This version of DecafMUD will depart from the [original](http://decafmud.stendec.me/) [version](https://github.com/stendec/DecafMUD) in that it will be designed soley to support the [Discworld MUD](http://discworld.atuin.net/lpc/), and no other MUDs or applications. If the codebase departs significantly enough, we will change the name of the client in the future, so as to not besmerch the name of the original creator.
